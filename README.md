#### **SOLID Overview**
- [SOLID Design Principles Introduction](docs/solid-principles/SOLID-Design-Principles-Introduction.md) - Complete guide to SOLID principles introduced by Robert C. Martin, including history, cross-principle comparisons, and real-world ASP.NET Core applications

#### **The Five SOLID Principles**
- [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](docs/solid-principles/single-responsibility-principle.md) - One class, one responsibility - ensure each class has only one reason to change
- [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](docs/solid-principles/open-closed-principle.md) - Open for extension, closed for modification - add features without changing existing code
- [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](docs/solid-principles/liskov-substitution-principle.md) - Subtypes must be substitutable for base types - maintain contracts in inheritance
- [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](docs/solid-principles/interface-segregation-principle.md) - Many small interfaces over one fat interface - clients shouldn't depend on unused methods
- [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](docs/solid-principles/dependency-inversion-principle.md) - Depend on abstractions, not concretions - high-level and low-level modules depend on interfaces

**What You'll Learn:**
- Historical context and evolution of each principle
- Detailed before/after code examples with violations and corrections
- Real-world enterprise scenarios in ASP.NET Core applications
- Interview questions with comprehensive answers
- Cross-principle relationships and how they work together
- Common anti-patterns and how to avoid them
- Performance and maintainability impact analysis
